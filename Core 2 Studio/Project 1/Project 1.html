      <p class="from-me">Like is this an earthquake just go back to sleep</p>
      <p class="from-them margin-b_one">It&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;this is an earthquake. Check the Internet. Yup. Earthquake. This is the size. This is the epicenter. Check social media. Make sure the East Coast knows I&rsquo;m alive. Okay, try and go back to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
